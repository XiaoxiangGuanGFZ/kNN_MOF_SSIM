# T_CP == TRUE: the disaggregation algorithm conditioned on circulation patterns

# MONTH == TRUE, the disaggregation is conditioned on 12 months, and T_CP should be set as FALSE. 
MONTH,TRUE

# SEASON, SUMMER_FROM, and SUMMER_TO: only valid when MONTH == FALSE; 
# SEASON == TRUE, meaning that the disaggregation is also conditioned on two seasons: summer and winter
