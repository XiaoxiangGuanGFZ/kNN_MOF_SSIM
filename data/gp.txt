# T_CP == TRUE: the disaggregation algorithm conditioned on circulation patterns

# MONTH == TRUE, the disaggregation is conditioned on 12 months, and T_CP should be set as FALSE. 
MONTH,FALSE

# SEASON, SUMMER_FROM, and SUMMER_TO: only valid when MONTH == FALSE; 
# SEASON == TRUE, meaning that the disaggregation is also conditioned on two seasons: summer and winter 

SEASON,TRUE

# Two arguments to define the two seasons 
# summer: from May to October (5-10)
# winter: from November to next April (11-4)

# the flexibility level of wet-dry status in candidates filtering
# WD:0 very strict, only the candidates with exact the same wet-dry status of target day can be selected
# WD:1 flexible, the candidates with same wet-dry status covering that of target day will be selected
# WD:-1 no restriction in terms of wet-dry status, calculate the SSIM as long as the candidate is wet in some sites
